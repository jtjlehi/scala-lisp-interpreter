# Lisp Interpreter

This is my first attempt at writing a lisp interpreter. I used the original 1963 paper by Mccarthy as a guide along with a few other things. This is also my first project with Scala. I wanted to use this project as a chance to improve my ability to read technical papers and learn the Scala Parser Combinator library.
